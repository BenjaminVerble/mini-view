# mini-view
a simple function for creating views

### To Run Examples in This Repo
`cd` to this repo, then `npm start`

### Why I Created This Module
- to modularize client-side code without creating too many abstractions
- to compose views together and create event handlers before attaching features to a web page / app

### Credits

TODO: 
- find a more clever module name
- write a few tests

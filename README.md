# mini-view
a simple function for creating views

### To Run Examples in This Repo
`cd` to this repo, then `npm start`

### Why I Created This Module
- I wanted a way to modularize client-side code without creating too many abstractions.
- I like Backbone and other frameworks' concept of View (view controller / controller), but I thought it might be possible to do use something simpler in many cases, especially for simple websites.
- I wanted to be able to compose views together and create event handlers before attaching features to a web page / app.
